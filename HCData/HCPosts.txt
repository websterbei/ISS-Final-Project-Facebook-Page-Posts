I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.\n\nThis is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I\u2019m sorry we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.\n\nBut I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together\u2014this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America, and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.\n\nI know how disappointed you feel, because I feel it too. And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful, and it will be for a long time. But I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love\u2014and about building an America that\u2019s hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted.\n\nWe have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America\u2014and I always will. And if you do, too, then we must accept this result\u2014and then look to the future.\n\nDonald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\n\nOur constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power, and we don\u2019t just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things\u2014the rule of law, the principle that we\u2019re all equal in rights and dignity, and the freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these things too\u2014and we must defend them.\n\nAnd let me add: Our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years, but all the time. So let\u2019s do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear: making our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top; protecting our country and protecting our planet; and breaking down all the barriers that hold anyone back from achieving their dreams.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American Dream is big enough for everyone\u2014for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. Our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will. I am so grateful to stand with all of you.\n\nI want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. It gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front-lines of our democracy, representing Virginia in the Senate.\n\nTo Barack and Michelle Obama: Our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude for your graceful, determined leadership, and so do I.\n\nTo Bill, Chelsea, Marc, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers, and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express.\nYou crisscrossed this country on my behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most\u2014even 4-month-old Aidan traveling with his mom.\n\nI will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country who poured their hearts into this campaign. For you veterans, this was a campaign after a campaign \u2014 for some of you, this was your first campaign ever. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anyone has had.\n\nTo all the volunteers, community leaders, activists, and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook\u2014even in secret or in private: Thank you.\n\nTo everyone who sent in contributions as small as $5 and kept us going, thank you.\n\nAnd to all the young people in particular, I want you to hear this. I\u2019ve spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I\u2019ve had successes and I\u2019ve had setbacks\u2014sometimes really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.\n\nThis loss hurts. But please, please never stop believing that fighting for what\u2019s right is worth it. It\u2019s always worth it. And we need you keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.\n\nTo all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.\n\nI know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling. But some day someone will\u2014hopefully sooner than we might think right now.\n\nAnd to all the little girls watching right now, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.\n\nFinally, I am grateful to our country for all it has given me.\nI count my blessings every day that I am an American. And I still believe, as deeply as I ever have, that if we stand together and work together, with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions, and love for this nation\u2014our best days are still ahead of us.\n\nYou know I believe we are stronger together and will go forward together. And you should never be sorry that you fought for that.\nScripture tells us: \u201cLet us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.\u201d\n\nMy friends, let us have faith in each other. Let us not grow weary. Let us not lose heart. For there are more seasons to come and there is more work to do.\n\nI am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election.

She believes we can summon what\u2019s best in each of us and make this country better for all of us.  \n\nThat\u2019s what America is about.

Chip in now to say you're standing with Hillary: hrc.io/donatenow\n\n\"By now, you've probably heard some news about a bewildering letter sent to Congressional leaders by the Director of the FBI. This is all a bit confusing, and much of the reporting has been misleading or downright inaccurate, so I want to take a minute to walk through this. \n\nHere's the quick backstory: In July, FBI Director Jim Comey concluded a year-long investigation by deciding not to go forward with any case about Hillary's emails. It wasn't even a close call, he said. In his words, 'no reasonable prosecutor' would have brought charges.\n\nYesterday, in a surprise to us all, Comey wrote a very strange letter to Congress that was long on innuendo and short on facts. He said that in a completely separate investigation, the FBI had found some emails that may or may not be related to Hillary, and indeed may or may not be significant at all.\n\nIt's being reported that Comey sent this letter over the objections of Department of Justice officials who told him that it was inconsistent with longstanding policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations not to take action that might impact an election. It's an unprecedented intrusion into a close presidential election with less than 11 days until Election Day.\n \nVoters deserve answers.\n\nComey needs to come clean with the American people about what he found and answer all the questions about why he took this unprecedented step less than weeks before the election.\n\nHere's what this changes for you and this campaign: Absolutely nothing.\n\nThe facts be damned\u2014Trump's always shown a complete disregard for the truth. In spite of there being no new information, he's already raising money off the bizarre letter (he literally sent a text message asking for money within an hour of the story breaking!) and he's more fired up than ever on the trail today.\n\nThese are the actions of a desperate man. Trump knows he can't win on his character, temperament, or his policies. He's behind, so he'll cling to whatever he can. We can't let him get away with this.\n\nOur organizers and volunteers on the ground are rallying behind Hillary in what will be the biggest volunteer weekend of the campaign so far. You need to have her back, too. You need to say you're not willing to let Trump bully or buy his way into the presidency, and you're not going to let anything stop us from making history.\n\nThere are ten days to go.

Hear me: the staggering stakes, the brutal hours, the overwhelming stresses. And here's the thing\u2014she still wants to take it on.

So when I hear folks saying they don\u2019t feel inspired in this election\u2014well, let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I have had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job. And here\u2019s what I absolutely know for sure: Right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president. Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State. That\u2019s why I\u2019m inspired by Hillary. I\u2019m inspired by her persistence and her consistency, by her heart and her guts. And I\u2019m inspired by her lifelong record of public service. No one in our lifetime has ever had as much experience and exposure to the presidency\u2014not Barack; not Bill. And, yes, happens to be a woman.  \n\n\"So we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative.

It\u2019s about whether or not the candidate can handle the awesome responsibility of leading this country. So, ask yourselves: Which candidate really has the experience, the maturity, and the demeanor to handle the job I described to you? Which candidate\u2019s words and actions speak to the future we want for our country and the values we share\u2014values like inclusion and opportunity, service and sacrifice for others?

We do need to support police departments and stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect us. We do need to reduce gun violence.
