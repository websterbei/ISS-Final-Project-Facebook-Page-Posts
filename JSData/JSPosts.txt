Over 160 water protectors have been injured from a vicious assault by DAPL security using water cannons in subfreezing weather, rubber bullets, concussion grenades, sound cannon, tear gas and mace.\n \nIt is appalling that even before Donald Trump takes office, this violent repression is already ongoing. Indigenous people were the first group to be brutalized and oppressed when the first European settlers came to American shores. Now they are at the frontlines of an increasingly protofascist nation.  \n\nStanding Rock is a microcosm of the crisis we face, where the violation of human rights, water, land, climate and democracy are converging.\n\nPresident Obama stated he wanted to stand back and see what happens. Now he has seen what happens. It\u2019s time for the Army Corp of Engineers to definitively deny the permit the Dakota Access Pipeline needs to drill beneath the Missouri River. It\u2019s time to stop this assault on humanity and Mother Earth for once and for all.\n\nAjamu Baraka and I will be visiting Standing Rock in early December to face the charges filed against us for peaceful civil disobedience in support of the water protectors. We will also be there to support the ongoing struggle. Ajamu and I invite President Obama to join us, and to see for himself what this struggle for land, water, indigenous rights, human rights, mother earth and democracy looks like. \n\nThis is the time for all of us, including the President of the United States, to do the right thing - no matter how you voted, no matter what party you might or might not identify with.

The political triumph of Donald Trump shattered the establishments in the Democratic and Republican parties \u2013 both wedded to the rule of Big Money and to the reign of meretricious politicians.\n\nThe Bush and Clinton dynasties were destroyed by the media-saturated lure of the pseudo-populist billionaire with narcissist sensibilities and ugly, fascist proclivities. The monumental election of Trump was a desperate and xenophobic cry of human hearts for a way out from under the devastation of a disintegrating neoliberal order \u2013 a nostalgic return to an imaginary past of greatness.\n\nWhite working- and middle-class fellow citizens \u2013 out of anger and anguish \u2013 rejected the economic neglect of neoliberal policies and the self-righteous arrogance of elites. Yet these same citizens also supported a candidate who appeared to blame their social misery on minorities, and who alienated Mexican immigrants, Muslims, black people, Jews, gay people, women and China in the process.\n\nThis lethal fusion of economic insecurity and cultural scapegoating brought neoliberalism to its knees. In short, the abysmal failure of the Democratic party to speak to the arrested mobility and escalating poverty of working people unleashed a hate-filled populism and protectionism that threaten to tear apart the fragile fiber of what is left of US democracy. And since the most explosive fault lines in present-day America are first and foremost racial, then gender, homophobic, ethnic and religious, we gird ourselves for a frightening future.\n\nWhat is to be done? First we must try to tell the truth and a condition of truth is to allow suffering to speak. For 40 years, neoliberals lived in a world of denial and indifference to the suffering of poor and working people and obsessed with the spectacle of success. Second we must bear witness to justice. We must ground our truth-telling in a willingness to suffer and sacrifice as we resist domination. Third we must remember courageous exemplars like Martin Luther King Jr, who provide moral and spiritual inspiration as we build multiracial alliances to combat poverty and xenophobia, Wall Street crimes and war crimes, global warming and police abuse \u2013 and to protect precious rights and liberties.\n\nThe age of Obama was the last gasp of neoliberalism. Despite some progressive words and symbolic gestures, Obama chose to ignore Wall Street crimes, reject bailouts for homeowners, oversee growing inequality and facilitate war crimes like US drones killing innocent civilians abroad.\n\nRightwing attacks on Obama \u2013 and Trump-inspired racist hatred of him \u2013 have made it nearly impossible to hear the progressive critiques of Obama. The president has been reluctant to target black suffering \u2013 be it in overcrowded prisons, decrepit schools or declining workplaces. Yet, despite that, we get celebrations of the neoliberal status quo couched in racial symbolism and personal legacy. Meanwhile, poor and working class citizens of all colors have continued to suffer in relative silence.\n\nIn this sense, Trump\u2019s election was enabled by the neoliberal policies of the Clintons and Obama that overlooked the plight of our most vulnerable citizens. The progressive populism of Bernie Sanders nearly toppled the establishment of the Democratic party but Clinton and Obama came to the rescue to preserve the status quo. And I do believe Sanders would have beat Trump to avert this neofascist outcome!\n\nIn this bleak moment, we must inspire each other driven by a democratic soulcraft of integrity, courage, empathy and a mature sense of history \u2013 even as it seems our democracy is slipping away.\n\nWe must not turn away from the forgotten people of US foreign policy \u2013 such as Palestinians under Israeli occupation, Yemen\u2019s civilians killed by US-sponsored Saudi troops or Africans subject to expanding US military presence.\n\nAs one whose great family and people survived and thrived through slavery, Jim Crow and lynching, Trump\u2019s neofascist rhetoric and predictable authoritarian reign is just another ugly moment that calls forth the best of who we are and what we can do.\n\nFor us in these times, to even have hope is too abstract, too detached, too spectatorial. Instead we must be a hope, a participant and a force for good as we face this catastrophe.\"\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/17/american-neoliberalism-cornel-west-2016-election", "likes": 1935, "time": 1479762001.0}, {"message": "A Call For Medical Supplies:\n\n\"An updated list can be found on Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council and website, but are in desperate need of the following:\n\nMilk of Magnesia \nWool socks\nWool blankets \nSpace blankets \nHand warmers\nTrauma kits (portable)\nFunding for advanced practitioner gear\nFunding for climate-controlled storage \nStraw bales\n\nAnd MOST of all...funding for winter structures.

For example, MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow concocted a scenario in which by taking every Stein vote and half of Johnson\u2019s votes, Clinton could have grabbed enough states from Trump to eke out an electoral college win, a story repeated by CNN. Unwilling to accept that Clinton didn\u2019t motivate enough voters to win the presidency, and explore the reasons why, many pundits are instead looking to put responsibility for the loss onto others.\n\nIn Maddow\u2019s fantasy, where Johnson drops and Clinton inherits half of Libertarian voters, where does the other half go? In reality, exit polls showed that only 25% of Johnson and Stein voters preferred Clinton to 14-15% who preferred Trump, while the majority \u2013 55% of Johnson voters and 61% of Stein voters \u2013 simply wouldn\u2019t have voted for either. If we were barred from running, Clinton might have gained a net 10-11% of those voters, but still lost solidly.\n\nBut these hypotheticals are delusional. Candidates can\u2019t snap their fingers and make their supporters vote for someone else they don\u2019t support. Pundits may think their favored party is entitled to those votes, but actual voters make their own decisions. No candidate owns anyone\u2019s vote \u2013 votes have to be earned.\n\nLooking for scapegoats is a way to avoid reflection, criticism and accountability after failure. Those who claimed that Clinton was more electable than Bernie Sanders, despite his stronger polling against Trump, are now desperately trying to spin the failure of their strategy.\n\nCorporate media gives alternative parties just a tiny fraction of their election coverage. When we do get covered, smear campaigns and \u201cspoiler\u201d charges dominate the discussion. Incredibly, pundits justify our exclusion from the airwaves and debates by saying we aren\u2019t a factor \u2013 yet after election day they declare us the most important factor.\n\nCalling anyone outside the two-party system a \u201cspoiler\u201d with no right to run is anti-democratic. It suppresses political competition, discourages citizen participation in democracy and shields the toxic two-party system from criticism or reform.\n\nAlternative party voters don\u2019t consider it \u201cpragmatic\u201d to perpetuate a two-party system that keeps getting worse. Many of them make deliberate decisions to use their votes to change that system long-term. Yet after making minimal effort to understand these voters, pundits caricature them as selfish idiots, normalizing hateful, bullying behavior and threats towards anyone who steps outside the collapsing two-party box.\n\nThe American people want more choices, not fewer. Some 57% think a new major party is needed because the establishment parties do such a poor job. 2016 reached a new low with the most disliked candidates in history. If most of us want more choices, shouldn\u2019t the media inform us about other candidates on the ballot, instead of attacking them? When can we move past this two-party trap and take our democracy into our own hands?\n\nThe good news: voters in Maine and elsewhere are tackling the \u201cspoiler problem\u201d head on with ranked choice voting. This voting system lets you rank your choices, so if your first choice loses, your vote is automatically reassigned to your second choice. Ranked choice voting empowers you to vote for the candidates who best represent your values. No one can tell you you\u2019re \u201cthrowing your vote away\u201d if you don\u2019t vote for the \u201clesser evil\u201d in order to stop the candidate you fear most. Ranked choice voting also rewards both candidates and voters who find common ground with opponents, rather than slamming them with negative attacks.\n\nSo are the runner-ups of this bitter election merely looking for a scapegoat, or are they willing to work constructively to fix systemic problems? The very fact that the political and media establishment was able to ram two historically unpopular candidates down our collective throats exposes a critical need for greater democracy. Ranked choice voting is an obvious first step.\n\nIt\u2019s said that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat its mistakes. So the real question is: who\u2019s ready to join us and get to work fixing our broken electoral system?\"\n\nFor more information on Ranked Choice Voting: jill2016.com/RCV", "likes": 6655, "time": 1479341701.0}, {"message": "\"The Stein/Baraka campaign expresses outrage at the horrific attacks and threats that have been leveled at communities that are in the crosshairs of a Trump presidency.

They expressed their solidarity and empathy with those who are traumatized by the election results, and called for an honest and sober reckoning of the collusion between the political establishment and corporate media that led to Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"A New York Times poll reveals that 82% of Americans are literally \u2018disgusted\u2019 by this election,\" said Dr. Jill Stein, Green Party presidential candidate. \u201cThis election is a reaction to what voters see as a toxic and corrupt political establishment and represents a wholesale rejection of it. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) sabotaged Bernie Sanders, who by all accounts would have easily trounced Donald Trump. Because of Wikileaks, we also know that the DNC actively colluded with corporate media to elevate Donald Trump as a \u2018Pied Piper Candidate\u2019 to encourage the most extreme elements of the Republican party,\u201d she said.\n\nShe continued, \u201cThe DNC\u2019s cynical political calculations, as well as the public\u2019s mistrust and rejection of Clinton\u2019s policies of endless wars for oil, disastrous trade deals, and support for Wall Street deregulation that crashed the economy and devastated the lives of millions -- all this together has resulted in horrific blowback that puts us all in danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stand in solidarity with the communities that have suffered from harassment, voter suppression, and now the trauma of a Donald Trump victory and what it represents,\u201d said Ajamu Baraka, Green Party vice-presidential candidate. \u201cWe must build alternative power. We need principled and strong social movements that express and agitate for the needs of the American people, and a political party to represent that movement at the ballot box. Over one million people voted for the Green Party ticket. We are the electoral arm of that social movement.\u201d\n\nGreen Party activists are hitting the ground running the day after the election. The Green Party calls for direct actions against the passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the lame duck session, and is co-organizing for \u201cOccupy Inauguration\u201d demonstrations on January 20 and 21 (also the anniversary of Citizens United). \n\nThe party also commends several state-level victories for institutional reform in this election, including the passage of ranked-choice voting in Maine.  Ranked Choice Voting would end the role of fear-voting in elections by allowing voters to rank their choices for president  (or other single winner offices) - knowing that if one\u2019s first choice loses, their vote is automatically reassigned to their second choice. In addition, the Stein/Baraka campaign praised resolutions calling for a constitutional amendment to abolish corporate constitutional rights and the concept of money as speech in Washington and California.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mourn, organize,\u201d said David Cobb, Stein/Baraka campaign manager. \u201cThis government is premised upon the concept of \u2018consent of the governed.\u2019 We do not consent to Donald Trump and right wing rule. We do not consent to the establishment of corporate rule. We do not consent to Empire.

FEC Supreme Court ruling, are political advocacy groups known as \u201cdark money\u201d groups because they allow for virtually unlimited and unregulated contributions. However, one of the few rules is that political campaigns, which have stricter campaign finance regulations and disclosure requirements, may not coordinate with Super PACs on paid activities. Such coordination would be functionally equivalent to an in-kind donation to the campaign from these dark-money groups.\n\nIn other words, coordination with Super PACs would allow political campaigns to direct the spending of unlimited amounts of money from undisclosed sources using Super PACs as front organizations, completely destroying the pretense that there are any rules for money in politics at all.\n\nThis complaint could bring about an end to the illegal collusion between super PACs and campaigns, whereby massive amounts of undisclosed money from corporations and the super rich pour into campaigns in violation of federal election campaign limits.\n\nThe Green Party has long advocated for a Constitutional Amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision, affirming that money is not speech, corporations are not people, and rights belong to living people, not corporations or other legal entities created to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few.\n\nThe Stein/Baraka campaign and the Green Party believe that ever-increasing amounts of money in politics are a major reason why the establishment parties have become so wildly out of touch with the needs of the American people. This complaint against the Trump and Clinton campaigns is just one step towards getting the big money out of politics so we can get the people back in.\"\n\njill2016.com/FEC", "likes": 12730, "time": 1478551565.0}, {"message": "The whole concept of \"spoiler\" candidates is designed to keep people voting in fear.\n\nEncourage your state to adopt Ranked Choice Voting to eliminate this anxiety: jill2016.com/rcv", "likes": 1355, "time": 1478547000.0}, {"message": "Capitalism \"says things like 'this kind of system is reflective of human nature.'

They have issued a call for solidarity, support, and supplies, and the Stein/Baraka campaign and the Green Party of the United States has answered the call. Green Party co-chair and Stein/Baraka staffer Andrea M\u00e9rida Cuellar and  Dawn Neptune Adams, an indigenous woman from the Penobscot tribe and member of the Maine Independent Green Party executive committee, and several members of the Colorado Green Party arrived in Standing Rock on Friday, November 4, to support the encampment and direct actions of the water protectors.\n\n\u201cColorado Greens gathered crucial supplies to support the front line water defenders, from pepper spray remedies to food to warm winter clothing,\u201d said Cuellar. \u201cAmong us is a union teacher, Peggy Robertson of United Opt Out and a Green, who with her son Sam is rebuilding and restocking the camp school and will teach, in the style of Oaxacan teachers.  We are all standing at the ready to serve and take full direction from the Indigenous leaders on the ground,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cMany Americans have decried the horrific images coming from this front line struggle,\u201d said Stein/Baraka campaign manager David Cobb. \u201cBut brutal exploitation and oppression has been the lived experience of the indigenous people of this continent for 500 years. Yes, we must stop this pipeline.  We must also come to terms with the history of attempted genocide and colonial conquest,\u201d Cobb added.\n\nThe human rights crisis continues to unfold at Standing Rock in North Dakota, where hundreds of water protectors have been arrested, pepper sprayed, shot at with rubber bullets, threatened with sound cannon and brutalized by police forces from seven states for peacefully protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Stein/Baraka campaign recently issued an official statement in support of the water protectors, and called on the US government to honor indigenous treaties and the right to free, prior, and informed consent under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\n\u201cThe shameful sight of militarized police at Standing Rock, inside the boundaries of treaty land claimed by the Great Sioux Nation through the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie, is the latest instance of a continuous thread of colonial oppression against indigenous people since 1492,\u201d noted Green Party vice-presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka. \u201cOur campaign is committed to establishing meaningful, respectful dialogue with indigenous peoples and ensuring that U.S. policies do not interfere with their rights to life, dignity, and autonomy.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama must go to Standing Rock himself, as Ajamu Baraka and I did in September, to witness what is happening,\u201d said Dr. Jill Stein, Green Party candidate for President. \u201cThis violation of human rights has no place in our country, nor any other country in the world. The Dakota Access Pipeline must be stopped immediately,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe must honor the historic role that indigenous people have always played - and must continue to play - in protecting Mother Earth and the ecosystems our lives depend on. As our planet\u2019s survival hangs in the balance, it is more critical than ever to respect the rights and sovereignty of our indigenous brothers and sisters - who are protectors for us all.\u201d\n\nFind out how you can help: jill2016.com/nodapl", "likes": 3309, "time": 1478482200.0}, {"message": "My campaign manager, David Cobb, is back to discuss what we're up to in Standing Rock to support the water protectors. #NoDAPL", "likes": 1261, "time": 1478480557.0}, {"message": "Looking for the key differences between me and Clinton, Johnson and Trump?

Like a lot of people, I was disappointed when Sanders lost the Democratic Primary race to Hillary Clinton.\n\nI hoped at that point that he might join forces with Jill Stein and the Green Party, but he declined that unique opportunity.\n\nBernie never spoke to the all-important issues of U.S. economic and military imperialism the way that Jill Stein has consistently done, but he was a credible voice for change in many other areas. He made his choice to get on the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party bandwagon because he appeared to feel that it would be the best way to prevent a Trump presidency.\n\nI understand and respect his stance, shared by many other well-intentioned and thoughtful people, but I believe it is short-sighted. It is not enough to simply say \u201cI tried, I voted for Bernie in the Democratic Primary, but now I have to get in line behind Hillary.\u201d\n\nThe powerful few who control national politics and the mainstream media by virtue of their overwhelming economic advantages are counting on supporters of Bernie Sanders and other political alternatives to now support the two Establishment candidates.\n\nThey are counting on no real change happening in the way this country is run and how average citizens are represented. At some point the system has to be overhauled, and the weeds have to be pulled out by the root. I do not want to reach the end of my life and have to accept that I did not vote my conscience as a citizen when it mattered most.\n\nDemocracy is not a fixed thing; it is an ongoing process that must be nurtured, pruned, and actively encouraged to grow or it will gradually cease to yield meaningful progress.\n\nTimes are changing and people all over this land - especially younger voters, who are the future of our republic's continuing democratic experiment - are awake and paying attention. They did not go to sleep when Bernie Sanders largely gave up the fight for significant change in our political-economic system.\n\nLike many that supported Bernie, I trust Hillary Clinton about as far as I can throw Donald Trump.\n\nJill Stein is the only candidate with a serious plan to halt climate change and switch to 100% renewable energy by 2030.\n\nShe\u2019s the only candidate, now that Sanders is out of the race, with a plan to release students from impossible levels of debt.\n\nShe\u2019s also the only candidate who is talking seriously about Black Lives Matter, institutional racism, and police brutality\u2014and she has realistic and workable plans to address these social problems.\n\nShe is also taking a stand against unexamined military overspending and the irresponsible and often criminal misuse of those who volunteer to serve in our country\u2019s armed forces.\n\nShe eloquently draws attention to the patriots who are forced to fight in illegal, immoral, unnecessary, and unwinnable wars. As she has unflinchingly pointed out, \"This results in a multitude of deaths, injuries (both mental and physical) and presents a crisis of conscience situation for many in combat.\n\nFollowing discharge, veterans are much more likely to commit suicide, become homeless, become dependent on drugs or alcohol, and have significantly higher rates of divorce, spousal and child abuse.\u201d\n\nJill Stein knows that these are problems that have not been honestly addressed, and that it is extremely unfair that those willing to give the ultimate sacrifice for their country are not properly supported or taken care of. Unlike Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, she will never deploy troops into unnecessary or illegal combat.\n\nShe cares deeply about our country being truly exemplary - in action and not just in high-sounding words uttered by our political leaders - as a member of the family of nations. For these and other positions that Jill Stein and her running mate Ajamu Baraka hold, I strongly recommend that voters take the time to have a look at the website jill2016.com and follow Jill Stein and the Green Party on social media.\n\nYou may agree or disagree with Jill on some points, but I sincerely believe that you are doing your conscience a disservice if you ignore her well-considered and constructive proposals.\n\nIf you feel, as I do, that the issues that only Jill Stein has the courage and decency to fully address need urgently to be part of the national political discourse during this election and beyond, please donate now to Jill\u2019s campaign for President.\n\nJill's campaign has been hit hard by the Clinton campaign\u2019s fear-mongering, which has seriously driven down donations. You can help push back against these unprincipled attacks by making your defiant contribution today.\n\nSo, why am I voting for Jill Stein?\n\nBecause I have done my best to inform myself about the many important issues that face our country, because I am following my conscience as an engaged citizen and a passionate supporter of the democratic process.\n\nBecause now is the time, not later, because I will not be intimidated by those who operate out of fear of significant change, because I will not be dissuaded by those who are understandably nervous about thinking long-term, about standing firm in the eternal battle for socio-economic justice and true political freedom in this country.\n\nBecause I am proud to be part of an ongoing, centuries-old democratic experiment that ought to always stand for fairness, compassion, and strength based on common sense and human decency at home and abroad.\n\nBecause there is always hope.\n\nBecause all we need to do to help it thrive is to embrace it and cultivate it to the best of our abilities in a conscious effort to eliminate the real obstacles to liberty and justice for all.\n\nViggo Mortensen\"\n\nhttp://www.jill2016.com/viggo", "likes": 14294, "time": 1478358900.0}, {"message": "There is a ticket that stands up for the 99 percent.

That may have changed a little in the aftermath of the FBI\u2019s renewing of its email probe last week. But even so, the fears of many voters that a Donald Trump presidency might become a reality have abated.\n\nThose fears are not unfounded. Trump\u2019s failings as a candidate and a person are manifest, and he would be in a position to wreak considerable havoc if elected. That\u2019s especially true at the agency level, with the judiciary and in other arenas where the president can wield executive power. The wildcard aspect of his personality poses risks that can\u2019t be predicted, nor can anyone know the degree to which congress would be inclined to obstruct or approve his most damaging initiatives.\n\nWhat has been lost in the salacious and obsessive media coverage of the Republican nominee\u2019s outrageous behavior, bigoted remarks and appeal to the worst instincts of the electorate, however, is a critical examination of what a Clinton administration will mean for the nation. The FBI probe, information on tangled interests within the Clinton Foundation, evidence of influence peddling and Wikileaks revelations detailing manipulation of media and the democratic process, signal a plutocratic style of governance that is all too familiar and increasingly dominant at the federal level.\n\nThe content of what has been revealed in these leaks, as well as her lengthy track record in government and policy statements as a candidate yield an inescapable conclusion: Hillary Clinton represents the entrenched interests of the status quo. Her election will expand the excesses of global interventionism and corporate welfare that have characterized US policies for several decades \u2013 at tremendous, almost incalculable cost both domestically and internationally.\n\nDuring the campaign, Clinton has engaged in the type of saber-rattling one expects of presidential candidates, especially Democrats who seek to counter the party\u2019s image as weak on defense. She has agitated against Russian President Putin on Ukraine and Syria, and reiterated her belief in \u201cthe responsibility to protect,\u201d the rationale used to selectively promote the elitist economic agenda that she has so faithfully pursued over the years \u2013 even as the exercise of that dubious mission has resulted in widespread devastation in the Middle East, South America and elsewhere. A muddled and hypocritical foreign policy has created bitter enemies across the globe and angered US allies, yet Clinton supports the rudderless and demonstrably ineffective efforts of President Obama without a hint of irony.\n\nThe ill-advised and tragic wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to extract a heavy toll, and though opposition to those wars helped propel Barack Obama into office, the focus on ending them and preventing new ones has been blurred by the government\u2019s ongoing crusade, the so-called War on Terror. In reality little more than an extension of other armed conflicts the US has waged around the world, the deadly manifestations of the War on Terror have largely been met with silence or, depressingly, approval from much of what passes for the progressive movement. Sadly, Donald Trump\u2019s self destruction has provided a smoke screen for those on the left and the more moderate elements on the right who might ordinarily question Clinton\u2019s unabashed cheerleading for a continuation of these modified Cold-War strategies.\n\nBeyond the battlefield, Clinton\u2019s historical enthusiasm for \u201cfree\u201d but not fair trade \u2013 even while waffling on the TPP \u2013 gives credence to the belief that she will sacrifice the welfare of workers here and abroad for the unfettered profits of the business elites whom she has always served. In the face of documented inhumane labor practices and other related human rights abuses around the world, the Obama administration and those preceding it have steadfastly refused to demand changes as conditions of honoring trade agreements. As Secretary of State, Clinton had an opportunity to honor and promote the rights of working people around the world but failed to do so. Why would anyone expect her to change now?\n\nThe inflammatory rhetoric and actions of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stand in sharp contrast to the platform and orientation of the Green Party, which offers the only alternative in this election that will move decisively to draw down U.S. military interventions abroad and reduce the military budget to a sane level while redirecting increasingly scarce resources to rebuild the frayed social safety net and help those most in need here at home.\n\nThis election is about far more than our collective distaste for a hyper-inflated ego, and trading the noxious buffoonery and personal insults of Trump for the clear and present danger of Clinton\u2019s corporatist logic is no trade-off at all.\"\n\njill2016.com/finalstretch", "likes": 4529, "time": 1478145601.0}, {"message": "Thank you, Caitlin Johnstone, for refusing to accept the establishment's story on Hillary Clinton. \n\n\"She speaks from the voice of the powerful few.

It\u2019s a line from one of those Shakespeare plays where everyone dies in the end, and its use has become a way of pointing out when someone\u2019s frantic resistance to something reveals a lot more about their true agendas than they intended to let on. When you know that your government is lying to you and the media is helping them, such things can often be a useful way of figuring out exactly what\u2019s going on.\n\nTake for example the way corporate media, proven by WikiLeaks to be pervasively controlled by the Clintons and their allies far more than we ever knew, has continued to run smear pieces on Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, even while they assure everyone that Hillary has an insurmountable lead over Donald Trump.\n\nAttack editorials and smear pieces about Stein have been churned out by Clinton-allied media like cheap t-shirts at a Bangladeshi sweat shop since well before the Green Party convention, but lately, the frenzied attacks are getting even louder and more desperate. Last week John Oliver, whose employer HBO is owned by heavyweight Clinton contributor Time Warner, dedicated an entire rant to punching down on third parties and their supporters. Yesterday the Daily Beast, whose owner IAC is co-directed by Chelsea Clinton herself, ran a hit piece on the good doctor hilariously accusing her of having a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d because she has a standard investment portfolio.\n\nI\u2019m just going to type that out again because it makes my smug parts light up with glee: a publication, controlled by Hillary Clinton\u2019s daughter, ran a hit piece on Jill Stein, for having a conflict of interest.\n\nMy God that\u2019s good. I need a cigarette.\n\nJill Stein, if you haven\u2019t been following, is the only candidate on the ballot who has never been a Republican, the only candidate on the ballot who doesn\u2019t hate progressives, and the only candidate on the ballot pushing an actual progressive agenda. That means she\u2019s going to be pulling votes from people who would otherwise support Hillary \u201ccandidates must have a public position and a private position\u201d Clinton, who is currently pretending to care about progressives so they\u2019ll give her the power to privatize social security and start a war with Russia.\n\nOh, but Hillary doesn\u2019t need those votes, does she? The official narrative all over corporate media is that Clinton is now a shoe-in. ESPN\u2019s monolithic poll-crunching juggernaut FiveThirtyEight has Clinton as a very heavy favorite to win the election, its editor-in-chief Nate Silver reassuring us that \u201cTrump\u2019s chances of winning the election haven\u2019t improved very much in our forecast.\u201d You will remember Nate Silver as the inventor of the specious argument that Bernie Sanders is basically the same as Hillary Clinton because they \u201cvoted together 93% of the time when in Congress together,\u201d which is an incredibly disingenuous manipulation of the data, as Counterpunch reports. You may also remember Silver as the man whose Clinton-favoring system incorrectly predicted Hillary winning a number of the states she ended up losing to Bernie Sanders in the primary.\n\nCould it be that these folks are not nearly as confident in the results as they pretend to be? Are the Democrats\u2019 weighted polling practices as reported by Zero Hedge still being employed to discourage Trump voters and paint Clinton as an unstoppable force? If Hillary\u2019s lead has swelled to insurmountability, why have the attacks on Jill Stein increased instead of decreased? Is she taking far more votes from Clinton than the Nate Silvers are letting us know?\n\nOr is it broader than that? Is it simply that in this era of WikiLeaks, alternative media, and widespread internet access, too many people are opening their eyes and looking toward true rebels like Jill Stein? Are they so desperate to keep the progressives from taking over their party or replacing it that they need to grasp at straws by sponsoring hit pieces attacking her for having a standard investment portfolio?\n\nHow obnoxious is that, by the way? Jill Stein is trending on Facebook. That would usually fill me with happiness, but no, she\u2019s trending because of that stupid Chelsea Clinton smear piece. I can\u2019t believe this is getting traction at all. So this gets traction, but the email revealing Bill Clinton having \u201c500 conflicts of interest\u201d holds no interest for people? The same people who were outraged about Bernie\u2019s little retirement house are banging on about this too, but you never hear them get outraged about Hillary\u2019s $12 million appearance fee or Bill\u2019s million dollar \u201cgift\u201d from head chopping warlords.\n\nThe stupid is killing us. The stupid will kill us all.\n\nPeople have a really screwed up sense of equivalency. In the minds of many, apparently, Jill\u2019s mutual fund having a few oil shares in it is the same as hundreds of millions in actual corporate conflicts of interest where political favors are being bought and sold for money? How do people even compute it that way?\n\nBut it\u2019s always the same people, have you noticed that? The most amoral people are having a field day with this as if morals have any meaning for them at all. With the Clintons, any amount of criminality is just normal everyday stuff to them, they don\u2019t understand why anybody\u2019s making a fuss, in fact, the proof that she\u2019s such a great criminal makes them like her more. These same people suddenly become more pernickety and pious than your churchy Aunt Pearl when it comes to Jill Stein. Doesn\u2019t matter that Hillary actively sells fracking, Jill raising a few questions about the safety of GMO cucumbers is a deal-breaker. Doesn\u2019t matter that Hillary is blatantly shoving us headlong into war with Russia, Jill had some concerns about vaccines in her capacity as a doctor once. And now this.\n\nShe probably drives a car, you know. Good god, she probably uses gas for her cooking.\n\nNo, you\u2019re right Hillary people, she should definitely not fight the oil companies that are destroying our species while she\u2019s still using an iPhone.\n\nIn fact, we should all shut up about the impending climate apocalypse until we\u2019ve rid our own person completely of oil and plastics.\n\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re shutting down the only candidate in the race who is speaking up for the environment because her managed fund has some oil shares in it, just like pretty much everyone else\u2019s does. That\u2019s a really good, moral decision. Right? Let\u2019s spend all our intelligence defending the share portfolios of billionaires by smothering the presidential campaign of the only progressive candidate on the ballot. The only candidate who hasn\u2019t been a Republican. The only one who has a comprehensive plan for climate change.\n\nGood thinking, humans. You\u2019re really hitting that one out of the park.\n\nUgh. I\u2019m going to go lie down. Remember, dear reader, ignore their stories and watch their actions. Forget their narrative about what\u2019s happening, and watch what really makes them squeal. When it comes to Jill Stein, they protest too much.

After a voter has cast a provisional ballot, election officials determine whether or not to count the provisional ballot by verifying the voter\u2019s eligibility .  Sometimes states require voters to take additional steps to verify their eligibility in order for the provisional ballot to count such as submitting an acceptable form of identification at a board of elections office within a specified time period after Election Day.   \n\nIt is important to know that many poll workers are improperly trained to handle provisional ballots, and may fail to inform voters\u2019 of their right to cast a provisional ballot.  Poll workers may also mistakenly misinform an eligible voter entitled to cast a regular ballot that the voter must instead cast provisional ballot. Voters should therefore insist on their right to cast a normal ballot when their eligibility has not been challenged or called into question, and their right to cast a provisional ballot the voter believes he or she is eligible to vote but eligibility cannot be immediately determined.  Voters facing any issues on Election Day should not hesitate to contact 866-OUR-VOTE for assistance.\n\nVoters should be aware that areas with high percentages of racial and ethnic minority voters have the highest rates of provisional ballots, and a large proportion of these ballots are typically rejected.  Therefore, voters should take steps in advance of Election Day to ensure they will be able to cast a regular ballot, such as verifying they are registered to vote and ensuring they have the proper form of identification required by state law.  Visit www.866ourvote.org to assist you with these steps.\n\nThere are no clear and uniform standards for counting provisional ballots.  For example, many states do not count provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct, while others do.  Provisional ballots are typically rejected for one of four reasons: (1) the voter is not registered to vote; (2) the voter cast the provisional ballot in the wrong precinct or jurisdiction; (3) the voter did not complete or sign the provisional ballot; or (4) the voter did not provide sufficient identification.  Though it may be difficult on Election Day for a voter to know whether his or her provisional ballot will be counted, under the Help America Vote Act ALL states are required to provide provisional voters an opportunity to find out afterwards whether their provisional ballot was counted or rejected and, if rejected, the reasons for the rejection.\n\nVoters concerned about filling out provisional ballots should not hesitate to call 866-OUR-VOTE for further information.\n\nVOTER INTIMIDATION (from Election Protection)\n\nVoter intimidation involves putting undue pressure on or trying to coerce a person or group to suppress votes or to vote a certain way. There is an ugly history of voter intimidation targeting low-income and minority voters.  More recently, deceptive election practices have become more widespread, taking the place of historical state-sanctioned discrimination in voting like  literacy tests and poll taxes. These practices include the dissemination of false election information sent out through flyers, robocalls, the internet, and through social media, and low-income and minority voters remain frequent targets.  Some of the more notorious examples of voter intimidation include:\n\nVoters being threatened with arrest at their polling station if they have unpaid child support or unpaid parking tickets.\nMisleading robocalls to African-Americans in Maryland stating that there was no need to go vote because \u201cour goals have been met\u201d.\nFliers in Ohio and Virginia telling voters that Republicans vote on the actual election day while Democrats vote the day after.\nChallenges to African-American voters in Philadelphia by men carrying clipboards who drove a fleet of sedans with signs that looked like law enforcement insignia.\nVoters concerned that they are being targeted by deceptive election practices, in addition to alerting local authorities, should immediately contact 1-866-OUR-VOTE, because it is very unlikely they are the only ones and these practices must be stopped.\n\nVOTER CHALLENGERS (from Election Protection)\n\nGenerally, voter challengers can question the eligibility of a voter on Election Day before a voter completes and casts a ballot. Depending on state law, these challengers might be appointed by political parties or other organizations. Voter challenges are often fraught with discriminatory practices and can intimidate qualified voters from voting. Also, the problem voter challenger systems supposedly address \u2013 voter fraud \u2013 is mostly illusory.\n\nChallengers also cause Election Day confusion by creating delays and uncertainty, and can easily intimidate voters, particularly because mass challenges might be based solely upon the race of voters. An Ohio Republican Party plan in 2004, for example, would have involved challengers confronting 97% of new African-American voters in one location while only 14% of new voters in a majority white precinct would face a challenger.\n\nhttp://www.jill2016.com/votingproblems\nhttp://www.jill2016.com/rigged", "likes": 669, "time": 1477960200.0}, {"message": "This marks the sixth pipeline accident in October, according to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pipeline_accidents_in_the_United_States_in_the_21st_century#2016\n\nSeven people were reported injured in today's accident.\n\nFossil fuel extraction and transportation is unsustainable and plain dangerous.

Can you imagine not being able to turn on your faucet since 2014 because it is poisoned? Have you heard of Flint, Michigan? We have been forced to deal with all this because the deep embedded racism that formed this country is the FOUNDATION of our system. And this is just the damage being done in our country, and please, I haven't even begun to kind-of scratch the surface here. Could you imagine what the United States would be doing if Russia suddenly started putting their troops in Canada and Mexico? That is what we are doing to them right now.

And the willful ignorance of those you thought were your allies, is an excruciating pain\u2014a pain my grandmother once told me about, but had never taken real meaning until now.\n\nThis is why I am proud to cast my vote for Dr. Jill Stein and Mr. Ajamu Baraka. I know I'm on the right side of history. And I say that not to be snide, cocky or arrogant\u2014I say that because I feel unburdened.

But in fact, there are serious election integrity issues in the US that we need to address. Just as important, the system is rigged to ensure that the Democratic and Republican parties continue to dominate while political competition is effectively barred.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rigging of our political system to prevent competition begins with anti-democratic and discriminatory ballot access laws that force parties like the Greens to gather massive numbers of signatures, often much more than the establishment parties need, simply to appear on the ballot. After we spend our resources getting on the ballot, the media gives us less than 1% the coverage given to the establishment candidates, while constantly reinforcing the narrative that political competition is futile or worse. This marginalization leads to low poll numbers in polls that significantly undercount young people and independents, which happen to be the demographics that are most likely to vote Green. Then these poll numbers are used to justify locking ballot-qualified candidates out of debates and media coverage. This is clearly a self-perpetuating cycle that keeps the establishment parties in control, even when voters are ready to revolt in disgust against the candidates they\u2019ve chosen,\u201d said Stein. \u201cThis is a failing system badly in need of reforms such as ranked choice voting, an improved voting system that is on the statewide ballot in Maine.\u201d\n\nSocial scientists have already debunked Trump\u2019s myth of voter fraud. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University stated that \u201cit is more likely that an individual will be struck by lightning than he will impersonate another voter at the polls.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who worry about the integrity of our elections should be more concerned with the well-documented suppression of minority and poor voters by partisan secretaries of state and other election officials,\u201d said Ajamu Baraka, Green Vice Presidential candidate. \u201cSince the 2000 presidential election, a variety of techniques have been employed to disenfranchise large numbers of eligible voters, including voter ID laws, the deliberate purging of registered voters, the elimination of voting sites in minority neighborhoods and on college campuses, and intimidation at the polls.\u201d\n\nIn their full statement, Stein and Baraka pointed to documented evidence of major elections tainted by voter suppression, voter roll purges, and other troubling issues.\n\n\u201cA Stein/Baraka administration will propose federal legislation providing for universal national voter registration and election procedures,\u201d said Stein. \u201cWe call for immediate measures to help protect the vote on November 8, including:\n\nElectronic voting machines must have an auditable paper-based ballot trail.\n\nImmediately post-election, there must be a mandatory random audit of three percent of all ballots.\n\nOpen source code must be used to verify the vote count in states that use secret proprietary software. Systems like this, such as the Trachtenberg system, exist and are already in use.\n\nAll election jurisdictions with electronic ballot imaging technology and audit features must turn both these features on during the elections, and make ballot images and audit logs available as public records.\n\nIt is vital to the integrity of our elections and our democracy that every vote be counted.

Police and private security forces have engaged in violent actions against peaceful earth defenders who have come to protect the land and water from the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n \nWe condemn the violent repression of the peaceful protests against DAPL as human rights abuses, including the use of attack dogs and pepper spray against peaceful demonstrators, the persecution of journalists, the authorization of weaponized drones, the disruption of prayer ceremonies, and the desecration of sacred burial sites. These are not the actions of public servants sworn to protect and serve the community, but the unconscionable oppression of an occupying army against the original inhabitants of this land.\nThe water protectors have invoked their rights under the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie, which grants the Sioux Nation sovereignty over the territory. A Stein/Baraka administration would honor the Sioux claims under this treaty, as well as the right to free, informed, and prior consent under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We call for an immediate halt to the construction of the pipeline and all attempts on the part of the police to remove the water protectors.\n\nWe express our outrage and shame at the silence of the Obama administration and the other presidential candidates in regards to this human rights crisis. We stand with the 14-year-old girl who traveled to the Clinton campaign headquarters from Standing Rock today to deliver a letter appealing to Hillary Clinton for support. She was turned away at the door and the letter was not even accepted for review.\n \nThe Dakota Access Pipeline is not only a human rights crisis for indigenous peoples, but a catastrophic ecological crisis that will affect millions of people who depend on the Missouri River for drinking water. There have been over 3,000 pipeline accidents in the United States since 2010, including deadly explosions and spills that have contaminated whole ecosystems. In the past week alone, two pipelines have burst, including a massive incident on the Sunoco pipeline in Pennsylvania which dumped 55,000 gallons of gasoline into the Susquehanna River. There is zero expectation that the Dakota Access pipeline will be free of such problems, and could be even worse as it is intended to carry Bakken shale oil, one of the dirtiest and most volatile types of fossil fuel on the planet.\nFor hundreds of years, the U.S. government has stolen land from and brutalized indigenous peoples across this continent, prioritizing resource extraction for private profit over the public interest. The menacing presence of extractive industries throughout indigenous territories threatens everyone\u2019s survival. We cannot afford to continue putting corporate profits over people and the planet. Our campaign is committed to establishing meaningful, respectful dialogue with indigenous peoples and ensuring that U.S. policies do not interfere with their rights to life, dignity, and autonomy. We call for an end to these deadly practices, to eliminate fossil fuel dependency through a transition to 100% clean energy by 2030, and to respect indigenous rights as the first crucial step to building a better world.\n\nRead on our website: jill2016.com/standingwithstandingrock", "likes": 8420, "time": 1477619124.0}, {"message": "\"People tell me to compromise and vote for the lesser of two evils\u2014but I cannot compromise when it comes to my beliefs, especially when they involve human rights and systemic oppression.

We have always been clear that the path to a progressive revolution does not go through the Democratic Party, a position that Sen. Sanders had shared through most of his political career. \n\nAnd while we agree with Senator Sanders on many issues, including both analysis and solutions, there are also some significant differences that would have to be addressed. \n\nThis starts with foreign policy and the role of the US military, but includes specific domestic issues as well the abolition of student debt and the need to transition to 100% clean renewable energy by 2030.\n\nhttp://www.jill2016.com/statement_clarifying_sanders_offer", "likes": 5778, "time": 1468084198.0}, {"message": "A toxic mixture of racism and fear, mental illness, and the pervasive availability of guns is killing young and old alike, and terrorizing our nation from the inside.", "likes": 5363, "time": 1468017156.0}, {"message": "It took help from the ACLU, but my 2012 running mate Cheri Honkala has won our right to march during the Democratic National Con. #SeeYouInPhilly", "likes": 3951, "time": 1467943979.0}, {"message": "We just won a huge victory for voter choice, overcoming one of the most anti-democratic ballot access laws in America. \n\nThanks to everyone who helped put us on the ballot in my home state of Illinois!", "likes": 14774, "time": 1467931668.0}, {"message": "On Fox Business News I explained how we can cancel student debt, provide healthcare for all, and create millions of Green jobs without costing taxpayers any extra. \n\nNot your usual Fox morning news.", "likes": 17815, "time": 1467920344.0}, {"message": "Bernie Sanders was actually booed by House Democrats for saying the goal of politics is transforming America, not just winning elections.
