[{"message": "It is a rare privilege to play a part in shaping the future of a great nation. By offering Americans an honorable, principled choice in this election, and being joined by thousands of supporters and volunteers to make a credible third party ticket part of the national conversation, we took significant steps toward reshaping the political landscape. For that, I am both proud and grateful.\n\nThis campaign was not about Bill Weld and me. It was not even about 2016. It was about a small government, greater freedom movement that I am confident will take hold and grow well beyond this election. It was about showing millennials, young people and all Americans that they do not have to blindly accept a two party duopoly. We have hopefully set the stage for that movement to flourish and have real success at the polls. \n\nThis is a great nation filled with great people. Bill Weld and I are honored to have provided a voice for millions of those great people, and deeply grateful to all those who made this historic effort possible. \n\nToday is a day to wish the President-elect our best wishes, and a sincere hope that, together, we can get about the business of addressing the challenges this great nation faces.", "likes": 61868, "time": 1478710656.0}, {"message": "We made history tonight.

Mr. Trump appears willing to \u2018frisk\u2019 those protections away if they get in the way of his version of fixing things.
