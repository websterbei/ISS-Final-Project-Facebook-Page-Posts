I\u2019ve spent time with grieving mothers who\u2019ve lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future.

Thank you for your amazing support. LETS WIN this November - get out and VOTE!\n\n**REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY**\n\nThank you. It is always so great to be back in New Hampshire, the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey.\n\nI\u2019ve come to know and love the people of New Hampshire. You are strong, independent and you are free.\n\nWe are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.\n\nWe are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.\n\nWe are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American.\n\nWe are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\n\nWe are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.\n\nHillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.\n\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\n\nEverything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money.\n\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the money.\n\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the money.\n\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the money.\n\nThe special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nAgain, just follow the money.\n\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\n\nShe and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.\n\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\n\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\n\nFavors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.\n\nShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale \u2013 and if she ever got the chance, she\u2019d put the Oval Office up for sale too.\n\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. We're going to call them the FBI Immunity 5. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\n\nShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power \u2013 to keep their control over this country.\n\nThe American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.\n\nThe Clintons are the sordid past.\n\nWe are the bright future.\n\nWhile our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.\n\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\n\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don\u2019t think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton \u2013 they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she\u2019ll do nothing for them once the election is over \u2013 she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \u201csuper-predators.\u201d\n\nSame thing goes for Hispanic voters \u2013 they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.\n\nA Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nWe are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs.\n\nEvery wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order.\n\nWe will unleash the power of American energy \u2013 we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people.\n\nCommon core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice.\n\nThe catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.\n\nAnd the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated.\n\nNAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton \u2013 and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved. You\u2019ve lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\n\nHillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 which would destroy manufacturing in this state.\n\nHillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.\n\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\n\nFrom now on, it\u2019s going to be America First.\n\nHave you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?\n\nThink about it. For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed? Or for our infrastructure to be repaired? Or for the waste to be removed from the budget? For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students?\n\nAll the things you\u2019ve ever wanted for your country have been denied.\n\nThe reason for this is simple. It\u2019s because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don\u2019t want these changes to happen.\n\nThese special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative.\n\nShe\u2019s been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.\n\nShe\u2019s there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.\n\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors \u2013 we\u2019re taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\n\nThat includes keeping your family safe.\n\nNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America\u2019s large cities, and that it\u2019s the largest single-year increase in 45 years.\n\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.\n\nThe failed politicians and the arrogant media don\u2019t want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country. They just want me to go along with the status quo.\n\nWell, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us.\n\nWe will never back down from fighting to save American lives.\n\nThat also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Hillary Clinton can\u2019t even say the words.\n\nWe are also going to keep our country safe from drugs. New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border. The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled \u2013 once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people.\n\nI am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border \u2013 that is a promise.\n\nThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\n\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We\u2019re trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\n\nThey\u2019re all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.\n\nI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.\n\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\n\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\n\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.\n\nYou have 40 days until the election. You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.\n\nDo Not Let This Chance Slip Away.\n\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\n\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.\n\nHere is just some of the great things that will happen for your country:\n\nWe are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\n\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!", "likes": 16763, "time": 1475182505.0}, {"message": "My condolences to those involved in today's horrible accident in NJ and my deepest gratitude to all of the amazing first responders.", "likes": 42216, "time": 1475172393.0}, {"message": "The problem with Crooked Hillary's appeal?

It\u2019s so great to be in Wisconsin tonight.\n\nA recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin, and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll \u2013 and a new post-debate Google poll has us leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide, and that\u2019s despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.\n\nWe are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.\n\nHillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself.\n\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\n\nOne of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country. Our good friend, Sheriff Clarke, is here with us tonight.\n\nNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America\u2019s large cities, and that it\u2019s the largest single-year increase in 45 years.\n\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.\n\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\n\nAcross the entire nation, for cities of all sizes, small and large, the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year.\n\nThis is a national crisis.\n\nYet, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, continues to attack the police. First, she calls our supporters \u2013 many of them cops, soldiers and firefighters \u2013 deplorable and irredeemable.\n\nThen, in our debate this week, she accusses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of \u201cimplicit bias,\u201d \u2013 essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced.\n\nMaybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself. After all, she is the one who described young African-American men as \u201csuper-predators.\u201d\n\nHow can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens?\n\nHow can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists, deplorables and irredeemables?\n\nBy smearing tens of millions of hardworking, decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President.\n\nShe has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans, of all backgrounds, who just want to live in safety, security and peace.\n\nThe police officers she attacks are the same people \u2013 of all colors and nationalities \u2013 who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers.\n\nThose fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens.\n\nMy agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans, but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities. We are going to save thousands of lives.\n\nThe special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don\u2019t want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities. They don\u2019t want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens. They want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache.\n\nWell, I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us.\n\nI will never back down from fighting to save American lives.\n\nI will never back down from fighting to save America\u2019s inner cities.\n\nThe only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks. Follow The Money.\n\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don\u2019t think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton \u2013 they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she\u2019ll do nothing for them once the election is over \u2013 she never does, and that will never change.\n\nSame thing goes for Hispanic voters \u2013 they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.\n\n58% of African-American youth don\u2019t have jobs. There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours. 45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty.\n\nThe inner cities have been left behind.\n\nCrime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it\u2019s dangerous to walk down the street with your child. To the African-American community, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, I will fix it.\n\nI will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before.\n\nEverything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.\n\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow The Money.\n\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow The Money.\n\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow The Money.\n\nThe special interests who want open borders, for cheap labor, are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow The Money.\n\nShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power \u2013 to keep their control over this country.\n\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\n\nShe received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.\n\nShe and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office. It\u2019s all part of the rigged system being run at your expense.\n\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\n\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton \u2013 or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds. She even gave up 20% of America\u2019s uranium supply to Russia.\n\nShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale \u2013 and if she ever got the chance, she\u2019d put the Oval Office up for sale too.\n\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\n\nThe American people have had it with years, decades, of the Clintons\u2019 scandals and corruption.\n\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\n\nHillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.\n\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\n\nFrom now on, it\u2019s going to be America First.\n\nThese special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She\u2019s there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.\n\nLook at her career. She\u2019s been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She\u2019s failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on ISIS \u2013 in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world.\n\nShe failed upstate New York \u2013 promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left. All she did was name a post office and a highway.\n\nShe failed the inner cities.\n\nShe\u2019s failed women and children.\n\nThe only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.\n\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors \u2013 we\u2019re taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\n\nI\u2019m not owned or controlled by anyone \u2013 my loyalty is to you, and no one else. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nWe will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nWe are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child \u2013 including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America. We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education, and a great job.\n\nThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the Money.\n\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We\u2019re trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\n\nThey\u2019re all part of the same rigged political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th.\n\nGovernment will start working for you again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.\n\nThat\u2019s what I want to do for our country \u2013 I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people.\n\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\n\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th \u2013 and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is already underway.\n\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.\n\nYou have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.\n\nYou have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\n\nDon\u2019t let it slip away. Don\u2019t let this chance go. Stand up and be heard \u2013 for your family, for your city, for your country.\n\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.\n\nHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:\n\nI am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.

TRUMP'S MEETING WITH ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU\n\nNEW YORK, NY - Donald J. Trump met privately today with Prime Minister Netanyahu for over an hour at Mr. Trump's residence in Trump Tower. The two have known each other for many years and had the opportunity to discuss many topics important to both countries.\n\nMr. Trump and the Prime Minister discussed the special relationship between America and Israel and the unbreakable bond between the two countries. The topics of military assistance, security and regional stability were addressed. Mr. Trump agreed that the military assistance provided to Israel and missile defense cooperation with Israel are an excellent investment for America. Mr. Trump said that under a Trump administration, there will be extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries. Mr. Trump recognized Israel as a vital partner of the United States in the global war against radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nThey discussed at length the nuclear deal with Iran, the battle against ISIS and many other regional security concerns.\n\nMr. Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed at length Israel's successful experience with a security fence that helped secure its borders. They discussed Israel\u2019s burgeoning hi-tech and biotech economy and how it has made stunning advances improving and saving lives around the world. In particular, Mr. Trump noted Israel\u2019s emergence as a world leader in cyber defense and security and its cooperation with the United States in this regard.\n\nMr. Trump recognized that Israel and its citizens have suffered far too long on the front lines of Islamic terrorism. He agreed with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the Israeli people want a just and lasting peace with their neighbors, but that peace will only come when the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State.\n\nFinally, Mr. Trump acknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish People for over 3000 years, and that the United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel.\n\nThe meeting concluded with both leaders promising the highest level of mutual support and cooperation should Mr. Trump have the honor and privilege of being elected President of the United States.", "likes": 116607, "time": 1474822411.0}, {"message": "Thank you!

It\u2019s a silent nation of jobless Americans.\n\nLook no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM \u2013 today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.\n\nIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn\u2019t drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can\u2019t drink the water in Flint.\n\nWe are going to turn this around. My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.\n\nWe reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that\u2019s left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.\n\nEverything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.\nJobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.\n\nAll of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism \u2013 which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country \u2013 and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.\n\nUnder this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?\nIf we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.\n\nAmerica will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.\nInstead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world\u2019s great magnet for innovation and job creation.\n\nMy opponent\u2019s plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution \u2013 a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.\n\nThe only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton\u2019s scheme are the donors and the special interests.\nIn Hillary Clinton\u2019s America, we have surrendered our status as the world\u2019s great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.\n\nNot one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they\u2019re going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.\nIn the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I\u2019ve met the most amazing people. Every day, I\u2019ve seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.\n\nIn many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I\u2019ve visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.\n\nPoliticians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.\nWorse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable \u2013 how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?\n\nThe hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos \u2013 but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future. These are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don\u2019t have a voice.\n\nI am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.\nToo many of our leaders have forgotten that it\u2019s their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.\n\nI\u2019m not running to be President of the world. I\u2019m running to be President of the United States \u2013 and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.\n\nWe are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.\n\nIt\u2019s time to start thinking big once again.\nThat\u2019s why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth. In working with my economic team, we\u2019ve put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math.\n\nThis growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.\nIt will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.\n\nIt will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.\n\nRight now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter \u2013 that translates to millions of lost jobs. This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nOver the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.\n\nPerhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work. Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.\n\nOn top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it\u2019s first $10 trillion dollars in debt \u2013 it took President \n\nObama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.\nNow, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.\n\nInstead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.\n\nNever has so much money been spent so poorly.\nBut we\u2019re going to turn that all around. Here\u2019s how.\nIt begins with bold new tax reform.\n\nAs outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all \u2013 in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.\n\nBy lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.\n\nIn addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit \u2013 it won\u2019t even be close.\n\nThis is a working and middle class tax relief proposal. The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka. These proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.\n\nFamilies will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.\n\nParents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit \u2013 in the form a Childcare rebate \u2013 and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.\n\nA married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.\n\nA married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill. By contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.\n\nOne of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate \u2013 down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch.\nWe will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.\n\nOn top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it\u2019s $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.\n\nWe will turn America into a magnet for new jobs \u2013 and that means jobs in our poorest communities.\n\nNext, comes regulations. One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.\n\nRegulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry \u2013 and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.\n\nIn 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.\n\nI\u2019ve proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books. This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA\u2019s so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.\n\nWe\u2019re going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.\n\nEnergy reform is central to our plan as well\nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama\u2019s energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\nHillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.\n\nA Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will: increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually add over 500,000 new jobs annually\nincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.\nIn addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama \u2013 creating countless more jobs in the process.\n\nFinally, comes trade \u2013 the foundation for everything\nAmerica\u2019s annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year \u2013 an enormous drag on growth.\n\nBetween World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.\n\nPredatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.\n\nIt is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent\u2019s campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nThe verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they\u2019ve promoted \u2013 every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.\n\nOur manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.\n\nI have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps:\nI'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators \u2013 and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.\n\nWe are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country. \n\nWe will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.\n\nWe are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nNext, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.\nI am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.\n\nIf China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.\n\nJust the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America\u2019s intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.\n\nWe are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.\n\nHere is how the plan adds up. We are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan.\n\nOur economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.\n\nThat leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade \u2013 again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.\n\nIf our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.\n\nThis is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.\nThis is what our new future will look like. \n\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I\u2019m going to unleash American energy; I\u2019m going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I\u2019m going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I\u2019m going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I\u2019m going to save your 2nd amendment; I\u2019m going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I\u2019m going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA \u2013 and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\n\nAnd we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this country.\n\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "likes": 25638, "time": 1473957813.0}, {"message": "Washington\u2019s rigged system feeds on excessive regulations...the Trump plan will put an end to this on DAY ONE. -DJT", "likes": 15822, "time": 1473956863.0}, {"message": "We must replace the present policy of globalism...and replace it with a new policy of Americanism. -DJT", "likes": 29994, "time": 1473955580.0}, {"message": "As if it couldn't get any worse with Hillary! \n\nHillary Clinton has terrible JUDGEMENT (as Bernie Sanders said.)

I want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country. She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today.\n\nI want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues. We are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.\n\nOur campaign is about ideas. We\u2019re about solutions. I\u2019ve travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.\n\nI\u2019ve outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.\n\nRight now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things. I\u2019m asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.\n\nWe must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.\n\nWe have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people. Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don\u2019t have political power.\n\nThose in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.\n\nThat means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids. We want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone.\nThese solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force. Today, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs.\n\nFor many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense \u2013 even more than housing. Yet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area \u2013 and my opponent has no childcare plan.\n\nMany Americans are just one crisis away from disaster \u2013 a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home. There is no financial security.\nBut that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight. Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read\nthe full plan.\n\nThe first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America \u2013 including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians \u2013 to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.\n\nThey will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13. Because of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families. The deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.\n\nImportantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions\nto their families and to our society. Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.\n\nFor low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax \u2013 a major relief for low-income parents. This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.\n\nNext, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account. Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free. Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans \u2013 you won\u2019t have to depend on your employer to provide them.\nImmediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.\n\nThe money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities. Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year \u2013 they don\u2019t revert to employers or to the Treasury. Instead, the funds rollover \u2013 so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings.\n\nThese savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms\nI outlined last week.\n\nThe funds will remain in the account until the age of 18. Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.\n\nFor low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds \u2013 if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match. To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.\n\nThese Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.\n\nOur plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions. The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.\n\nBut to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities. We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.\n\nIn this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button \u2013 including services like nanny-sharing. Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents.\nOur plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well. \n\nThis can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time. Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services. Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.\n\nFinally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave. This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing. By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit. This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.\n\nThere are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.\n\nOn Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings. Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.\n\nThese are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President. It\u2019s time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together \u2013 not as Republicans or Democrats \u2013 but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people.\n\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, love your families, and want a better future for all Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people.\nIt's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.\n\nIt is time to Believe In America.\n\nTogether, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again.\n\nAnd Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone!\n\nThank you!", "likes": 37497, "time": 1473818670.0}, {"message": "Thank you America - I will not let you down!", "likes": 93913, "time": 1473809454.0}, {"message": "Join Ivanka Trump and I - LIVE in Aston, Pennsylvania at 7:30pmE via Right Side Broadcasting - as we unveil a new child-care policy.

TRUMP ADDRESSES CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES\n\nIt is so great to be back in New Hampshire. I have developed such deep affection for this state and for its people. My first victory took place here.\n\nOver the next 74 days, we are all going to work very hard together to win this state \u2013 just like we did in the primaries \u2013 and to win the White House for the American people.\n\nOur victory is going to be a victory for the great majority of Americans whose voice has not been heard.\n\nYear after year, we live under a Washington regime that ignores your demands, rejects your cries for help, and that always puts your needs last.\n\nThe real divide in this election is not between left and right, but between everyday working people and a corrupt political establishment that works only for itself.\n\nThis election is a chance for the great majority of decent citizens to end the rule of a small group of special interests and to return that power to the voters.\n\nHillary Clinton believes only in government of, by and for the powerful.\n\nI am promising government of, by and for the people.\n\nIn this fight, we are taking on some very entrenched and well-financed interests. These are the same people who pay Hillary $10,000 dollars a minute for a speech. These special interests are the same people who own the newspapers that cover-up her crimes. These are the Wall Street firms who paid Hillary Clinton a quarter of a million dollars each time she delivered her secret remarks. They are the same people who paid Bill and Hillary Clinton over $150 million dollars for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office \u2013 and who donated countless millions more to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nBut, you have the power, with your vote, to defeat those special interests and put the people back in charge once more.\n\nThis has been a historic week in American politics.\n\nThe voters have always known that our leadership in Washington D.C. is corrupt, and that the system is very badly rigged.\n\nBut this week the curtain was lifted. The corruption was revealed for all to see. The veil was pulled back on a vast criminal enterprise run out of the State Department by Hillary Clinton.\n\nAs the Associated Press documented, more than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took as Secretary of State with people outside government were Foundation donors.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s chief of staff received more messages from the Clinton Foundation\u2019s Chief Operating Officer than just about anyone else.\n\n85 donors alone that she met with as Secretary gave the Foundation $156 million dollars.\n\nOn top of that, Bill Clinton\u2019s total speaking fees rose 44% while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State \u2013 often raking in money from people who had business or matters before the State Department.\n\nAs I said weeks ago, Hillary Clinton ran the State Department like a personal hedge fund.\n\nIt is hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ended, and where the State Department began.\n\nAccess and favors were sold for cash. It\u2019s called Pay-For-Play.\n\nOver and over and over, people who donated to the Clinton Foundation \u2013 or who gave money to Bill Clinton \u2013 got favorable treatment from Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department.\n\nThe examples are too many to name here in full, and I\u2019ve gone over some in recent days. They include the deal to sell 20% of U.S. Uranium to Russia, or the favorable treatment for UBS. It includes the exemption of Telecom Giant Ericsson from government sanctions. It includes efforts to put a Foundation donor \u2013 with no national security experience \u2013 onto a highly-sensitive national security panel with access to top secret information. It includes Foundation donors getting lucrative contracts in Haiti \u2013 all while the people of Haiti suffered horribly.\n\nBut these examples are only the tip of the Clinton Corruption iceberg.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s actions constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise.\n\nShe created a private illegal email server in order to hide her corrupt dealings. She did so knowing full well it would put American lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking. But, she didn\u2019t care \u2013 as long as it helped her get away with her crime, no risk to America was too great.\n\nThen, to further cover-up her crime, she deleted 33,000 emails to keep them out of the hands of authorities and the American public.\n\nAs a further element of the criminal cover-up, she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her work related emails. We now know this to be one more massive Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she failed to turn over, including the new discovery this week of 15,000 more work-related emails she failed to disclose.\n\nWhat is being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in American political history.\n\nA Secretary of State sold her office to corporations and foreign governments, betraying the public trust \u2013 putting innocent lives in danger \u2013 and then she went to great lengths to hide, delete, destroy and lie about the evidence. Just like her lie that she never sent any material marked classified.\n\nLie after lie after lie.\n\nThis is the corruption we expect to see in a Third World country \u2013 but not in America.\n\nJust imagine the damage to our security, to our integrity, to our standing in the world, if Hillary Clinton is allowed to sell the Oval Office the same way she sold her office as Secretary of State.\n\nWe cannot let this happen.\n\nWe must vote on November 8th to keep the American government from being sold to the highest bidder.\n\nVote to save your country. Vote to protect your family. Vote for honesty, integrity and accountability.\n\nNow, as all of these revelations have been discovered this week, Hillary Clinton has been in hiding.\n\nBut today, she emerges. However, she is emerging not to take responsibility for her unethical and criminal conduct, but instead to make one of the most brazen attempts at distraction in the history of politics.\n\nNow, I have not seen Hillary Clinton\u2019s remarks. And, in a sense, I don\u2019t want to dignify them by dwelling on them too much, but a response is required for the sake of all decent voters she is trying to smear.\n\nThe news reports are that Hillary Clinton is going to try to accuse this campaign, and the millions of decent Americans who support this campaign, of being racists.\n\nIt\u2019s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook.\n\nWhen Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument. It\u2019s the last refuge of the discredited politician.\n\nThey keep going back to this same well, but the well has run dry.\n\nThis is the year that the people who have been betrayed by Democratic policies, including millions of African-American and Hispanic-American citizens, reject the politicians who have failed them and vote for change.\n\nAs I\u2019ve discussed for many days now, Democratic politicians have run nearly every inner city in America for fifty or sixty years or more. Their policies have produced only more poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.\n\nEvery policy Hillary Clinton supports is a policy that has failed and betrayed communities of color in this country. But she just doesn\u2019t care \u2013 she\u2019s too busy raking in cash from the people rigging the system.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty. 58% of African-American youth are not working. More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago this year alone.\n\nThese are the consequences of Hillary Clinton\u2019s policies. She has brought nothing but pain and heartache to our inner cities.\n\nOn top of that, she wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent. We should be helping these businesses to grow and expand \u2013 but Hillary Clinton is trying to shut them down.\n\nShe opposes school choice.\n\nShe supports open borders that violate the civil rights of African-Americans by giving their jobs to people here unlawfully.\n\nShe supports trade policies that have closed factories in African-American communities and put millions of African-Americans out of work.\n\nShe supports radical regulations that put Americans out of work and raise the price of their energy bills.\n\nShe supports policies on crime that make communities less safe, and that make it harder to raise your children in security and peace.\n\nI believe every single parent in this country \u2013 and especially in the inner cities \u2013 has the right to raise their kids in safety. This is one of the great civil rights issues of our time.\n\nBut Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t want to talk about any of this. She can\u2019t defend her record. She doesn\u2019t have one single proposal that hasn\u2019t been tried and failed. She doesn\u2019t have one idea that does anything but destroy jobs for African-American and Hispanic citizens \u2013 and all citizens \u2013 in our country.\n\nSo what does she do when she can\u2019t defend her record?\n\nShe lies, she smears, she paints decent Americans as racists. She bullies voters, who only want a better future, and tries to intimidate them out of voting for change.\n\nAs I discussed yesterday, these are the same tactics the establishment powers used to try to scare the British people out of voting for change too.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work there. It won\u2019t work here.\n\nThe American people are ready to vote for freedom, opportunity and justice. They are ready to take back control of their own futures.\n\nIt\u2019s time the Clintons were held accountable for their inappropriate conduct. According to the book Game Change, Bill Clinton said about President Barack Obama that \u201ca few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee.\u201d And we\u2019ve all seen the cringe-worthy comments from Hillary Clinton, which I won\u2019t get into here but we all know what they are.\n\nHere\u2019s the important point though that I want to get across today. Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t just attacking me, she\u2019s attacking all the people who support our movement.\n\nWe can\u2019t let that stand. Voters are used to the old game where failed politicians like Hillary Clinton falsely smear Republicans with charges of racism. Republicans then back down. Democrats then continue to push policies that are devastating to communities of color.\n\nWe must break this corrupt cycle. And we are going to break it beginning today.\n\nSo let me make some very clear statements before this whole country.\n\nFirst, on the border. People who want their laws enforced and respected, and who want their border secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs protected and their country kept safe. I will never apologize for pledging to enforce and uphold every single law of the United States, and to make my immigration priority defending and protecting American citizens above every other single consideration. We will end illegal immigration and we will restore the Constitutional rule of law.\n\nNext, on national security. People who speak out against Radical Islam, and who warn about refugees, are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our values as a tolerant society, and who want to keep the terrorists out of our country. If the choice is between saving lives \u2013 or appeasing politically-correct censors in Washington D.C., that is the easiest choice I will ever have to make. I will always choose saving American lives.\n\nNow, on crime. People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence. There is no compassion in tolerating crime, and poisonous drug dealing, and the killings in our streets. I will work to dismantle the criminal gangs and cartels and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and violence and poverty and fear.\n\nTo Hillary Clinton, and to her donors and advisors, pushing her to spread her smears and her lies about decent people, I have three words. I want you to hear these words, and remember these words: Shame On You.\n\nWhen you are like the Clintons, getting $69 million dollars in political contributions from Wall Street and Big Banks, it is easy to look down on the so-called little people. It\u2019s easy to ignore the devastation caused by our open borders when you spend all your time with wealthy donors and Hollywood celebrities. It is easy to ignore the heartfelt concerns of communities about Radical Islam entering our country, when you spend your time hanging out with foreign dictators in their lavish palaces. And it is easy, no doubt, for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to the ravages of crime, when she has her own personal armed security force.\n\nThis is how the system is rigged.\n\nFor decades, the American people have demanded that their immigration laws be enforced and that their jobs be protected from out-of-control immigration. But the special interests, who only want cheap labor, have stopped it from happening.\n\nFor years, the American people have worried about letting Radical Islam spread within our shores, but the elites \u2013 who only want to raise more money from global corporations \u2013 ignore the concerns of the American voters.\n\nFor fifty years, people living in our inner cities have suffered under a failed policy regime. But the Democratic politicians \u2013 who only want to please media executives and Wall Street donors \u2013 do nothing but expand the hurt and the suffering.\n\nIt is time for a new day to dawn in America.\n\nOn November 8th, we will end the rule of special interests \u2013 and we will begin the rule of the people.\n\nI am asking for your vote so that we can break free from the failures of the past and create a New American Future.\n\nI am asking for your vote so that we can achieve amazing things for the American people.\n\nI am asking for the vote of every African-American, and Hispanic-American, who wants a better future \u2013 a future that begins with jobs, jobs and more jobs.\n\nWe will fix our disastrous trade deals and stand up to countries that cheat.\n\nWe will lower taxes and create millions of new jobs as a result.\n\nWe will unleash an American energy revolution.\n\nWe will eliminate job-killing regulations.\n\nWe will repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare.\n\nWe will enforce our immigration laws, and we will put rules in place that hire American workers first.\n\nWe will end the era of nation-building, and instead work in partnership with our allies to crush and destroy ISIS.\n\nWe will keep Radical Islamic Terrorism out of our country.\n\nWe will promote the values of tolerance, justice and acceptance.\n\nWe will steadfastly reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms.\n\nAmerica will be one nation \u2013 united in common purpose and common dreams. Our citizens will proudly promote our values and our system of government as the best in the world \u2013 and we will do so without apology.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America Prosperous Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nFriends, citizens and fellow Americans: We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless! \n\nDonald J.

This makes a mockery of her promise to Congress and the President to keep the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton State Department entirely separate. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise. The need for a Special Prosecutor to investigate these apparent crimes mounts with every passing day and the revelation of new sets of e-mails and phone logs.

I love this state \u2013 where I once worked \u2013 and I love the people of this state.  \nI have a message for all of you tonight: we are going to win Ohio, we are going to win the White House, and we are going to bring back your jobs.\nWe are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.\n\nWe are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation.  We are going to stop the foreign cheating.\n\nThe era of economic surrender is over.  A new era of American Greatness is beginning.  No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.\n\nHillary Clinton backed her husband\u2019s NAFTA, she backed China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nOne bad deal after another.  Hillary Clinton\u2019s donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.  Ohio and the Akron area have lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.  This region and this state have lost nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.  Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.  This subtracts directly from our growth \u2013 our economy grew only 1.2 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.  This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.  \n\nI am promising a new legacy for America.\nWe are going to create a New American Future.\nBut to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  \n\nOur trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year.  Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.\n\nHillary Clinton, who called the TPP the \u201cGold Standard\u201d, would 100% approve it if she ever got in.  Her closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed that she would.\n\nWe won\u2019t let that happen.  We will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.  We will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.  It\u2019s going to be America First.\n\nMy economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.  \nHere are a few of the things we will do:\nA massive tax cut for working Americans, and a 15% tax rate for small businesses.\n\nWe are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration\u2019s new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.\n\nThese Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are a tax on the poor, and they devastate low-income African-American and Latino workers.\nOhio gets 60% of its electricity from coal-powered energy.\n\nHillary Clinton says she wants to \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d  Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.\n\nWe are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work \u2013 and we are going to get your energy bills down.  We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.\n\nAnother major part of our agenda is law and order.  More than 2,600 have been shot in Chicago alone since the beginning of this year.  This is one of the biggest differences between me and my opponent.  I believe that safety is a right that belongs to all Americans.  \n\nLet me take this opportunity to thank the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.\n\nWorking with communities and police, I pledge to bring safety to communities across this land \u2013 but especially to those places that have not known safety in a very, very long time.  I want every parent and child in this society \u2013 including every African-American and Hispanic citizen \u2013 to be able to live in a safe, thriving and prosperous community.\n\nThis is the New American Future that we are working together to create.  Hillary Clinton is the past.  We are the future.\n\nAnother major part of our agenda is immigration security.  We need to protect American jobs.  We need to protect American safety.\n\nLow-income workers are hurt the most by my opponent\u2019s policies. Poor Hispanic and African-American citizens are the first to lose a job, or see a pay cut, when we don\u2019t control our borders.\nAccording to Pew Research, immigration over the next fifty years will add another 100 million to our population.  It will be much, much more than even that under Hillary Clinton\u2019s radical plans.  That\u2019s unfair to the low-income workers \u2013 African-American, Latino, all Americans \u2013 living here today and trying to get ahead.\n\nHillary Clinton has forgotten the first rule of public service.  The job of an elected official is to serve the citizens of the United States.  If you don\u2019t understand that, then you cannot run for President.\nIf you are not prepared to put American workers first, then you should not hold or seek public office.\nIt\u2019s just that simple.  No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.\n\nAs the evidence has become public over the last several months, I have become increasingly shocked by the vast scope of Hillary Clinton\u2019s criminality.\n \n\ufffdHillary Clinton said she turned over all of her work related emails.  She testified that to Congress under penalty of perjury. Now we learn about another 15,000 emails she failed to turn over have just been discovered.  \n \nColin Powell just proved again how dishonest Hillary Clinton is after he busted her for trying to pin her email scandal on him \u2013 one more Hillary Clinton lie.\n   \nHer Foundation took in large payments from major corporations and wealthy individuals, foreign and domestic, all while she was Secretary of State.\n \nThe Clinton Foundation accepted as much as $60 million dollars from Middle Eastern countries that oppress women, gays and people of different faiths.\n \nThe Foundation donors included corporations and individuals with significant matters before the State Department. And then either Hillary Clinton herself or one of her closest aides took action favorable to the donor.\n \nHer actions corrupted and disgraced one of the most important Departments of government, indeed one of only four established by the United States Constitution itself.\n \nThe Clintons' made the State Department into the same kind of Pay-to-Play operations as the Arkansas Government was: pay the Clinton Foundation huge sums of money and throw in some big speaking fees for Bill Clinton and you got to play with the State Department.\n \nThe amounts involved, the favors done and the significant numbers of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a Special Prosecutor. After the FBI and Department of Justice whitewash of the Clinton email crimes, they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton\u2019s crimes.\n \nSome former prosecutors have even suggested that the coordination between the pay-for-play State Department and the corrupt Clinton Foundation constitute a clear example of a RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization) enterprise.\n \nThe Justice Department is required to appoint an independent Special Prosecutor because it has proven itself to be a political arm of the White House.  \n \nThe DOJ has acted very unethically, particularly the Attorney General's private lengthy meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before the Department's decision not to prosecute her for crimes that would have been prosecuted against almost any other citizen.\n \nIf the Justice Department fails to do so, it will make it even clearer that a second of the four primary constitutional Departments have been corrupted.\n \nHere is one example of Clinton Corruption.\n \nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium supply to the Russians. Clinton\u2019s approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars. In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations. In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.\n \n\ufffdHere is another example of pay-for-play.\n \n\ufffdIn 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments \u2013 including Sudan, Syria, and Iran.  Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.\n\nIn June 2011, Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department began adding goods and services to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nDuring that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 \u2013 his highest paying speech.\n\nIn April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria \u2013but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson\u2019s work in Iran.\n\nA Trump Administration will end the government corruption.  No one will be above the law.  We will have one set of rules for everyone.  In Hillary Clinton\u2019s world, we have one set of rules for her \u2013 and another set of rules for everyone else.\nI am fighting for everyone who doesn\u2019t have a voice.  The forgotten men and women of America.\nI am your voice.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.  My campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.\n\nNothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.\n\nCome November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.  We are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.\n\nWe are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.  We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don\u2019t support our tolerant values.\n\nWe are also going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.\nThe Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city for half a century or more.  They have produced only more poverty, failing schools, and broken homes.\n\nIn the last eight years, the African-American labor force participation has declined another 3 percentage points \u2013 and it\u2019s dropped another 6 percent for teenagers.  Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty.  African-American home ownership has declined nearly ten percentage points.\n\nMeanwhile, since 2009, another 2 million Latinos have fallen into poverty.  Incomes for Latino workers fell by almost another $1,000 dollars.\nMeanwhile, homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and more than 60 percent in Baltimore.  The level of crime in these cities is something no American should consider acceptable.  Our government has failed these residents.\n\nFor those hurting the most \u2013 who have been failed again and again by their politicians \u2013 I\u2019ve asked in recent days, what do you have to lose by trying something new?  If you keep voting for the same failed politicians you will keep getting the same results.  But, most importantly, I want to talk about what you have to gain.  Those hurting in our county have so much to gain by joining our campaign for a new, and more inclusive, American Future.\n\nMy tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.  \n\nMy energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the price of your energy bill.\n\nMy trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.\n\nMy immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visa programs that hurt poor workers.\n\nMy infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.\n\nMy regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.\n\nMy promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities.  Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.\n\nMy government reforms will make your voice heard \u2013 not the voice of the special interests.\nEvery insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.\nIt\u2019s the powerful protecting the powerful.\nInsiders fighting for insiders.  I am fighting for you.\n\nEvery day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.  Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.  Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.\nI wear their opposition as a badge of honor.  Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.  \n\nI am fighting \u2013 all of us across the country are fighting \u2013 for peaceful regime change in our own country.  The media-donor-political complex that\u2019s bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\n\nI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.  We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity \u2013 a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\n\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.  \n\nTo every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I\u2019m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.

It\u2019s great to be here in Charlotte. I just met with our many amazing employees right up the road at our property.\n\nI\u2019d like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.\n\nWe are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt \u2013 and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together.\n\nOur prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences. Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.\n\nWe are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.\n\nTonight, I\u2019d like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.\n\nLast week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.\n\nOn Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nOn Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.\n\nLet me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.\n\nThe chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens. If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end \u2013 and it will end very quickly.\n\nEvery single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.\n\nTo be one united nation, we must protect all of our people. But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.\n\nWe cannot make America Great Again if we leave any community behind.\n\nNearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.\n\nJobs, safety, opportunity. Fair and equal representation. This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.\n\nBut to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.\n\nAs you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I\u2019ve never wanted to use the language of the insiders, and I\u2019ve never been politically correct \u2013 it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.\n\nSometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don\u2019t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.\n\nBut one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.\n\nI speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn\u2019t have a voice.\n\nI speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.\n\nI speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need \u2013 and so many are not making it. They are dying.\n\nI speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.\n\nOur campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals \u2013 who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don\u2019t hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.\n\nThese are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.\n\nI am fighting for these forgotten Americans.\n\nFourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people. Every day since then, I\u2019ve worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.\n\nEvery day I think about how much is at stake for this country. This isn\u2019t just the fight of my life, it\u2019s the fight of our lives \u2013 together \u2013 to save our country.\n\nI refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream. Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.\n\nOur whole country loses every time a kid doesn\u2019t graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.\n\nWhen I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.\n\nIn the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.\n\nIf something isn\u2019t working, you replace it.\n\nIf a product doesn\u2019t deliver, you make a change.\n\nI have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity. A future where America, and its people, always \u2013 and I mean always \u2013 come first.\n\nAren\u2019t you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?\n\nAren\u2019t you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.\n\nAren\u2019t you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?\n\nThat is all about to change \u2013 and it\u2019s about to change soon. We are going to put the American people first again.\n\nI\u2019ve travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.\n\nIn this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. I will never put anyone\u2019s interests ahead of yours.\n\nAnd, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.\n\nI have no special interest. I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign \u2013 nobody else is.\n\nMy only interest is the American people.\n\nSo while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.\n\nThe American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she\u2019s told to them, and the many times she\u2019s betrayed them.\n\nTell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?\n\nHas Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?\n\nHas she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?\n\nHas she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?\n\nHas she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?\n\nHas Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?\n\nSpeaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran. He denied it was for the hostages, but it was. He said we don\u2019t pay ransom, but he did. He lied about the hostages \u2013 openly and blatantly \u2013 just like he lied about Obamacare.\n\nNow the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped. Hillary Clinton owns President Obama\u2019s Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the economy. Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.\n\nBill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Hillary Clinton-backed deal. Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State \u2013 our chief diplomat with China. She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.\n\nHillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you\u2019ll get that apology around the same time you\u2019ll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.\n\nAnother major issue in this campaign has been the border. Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities. So much needless suffering, so much preventable death. I\u2019ve spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.\n\nI\u2019ve embraced the crying parents who\u2019ve lost their children to violence spilling across our border. Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.\n\nMy opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.\n\nBut where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?\n\nWhere was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?\n\nThese moms and dads don\u2019t get a lot of consideration from our politicians. They certainly don\u2019t get apologies. They\u2019ll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut they will always come first to me.\n\nListen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families. We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.\n\nPlease remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security. I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests. I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs. I will never put the special interests before the national interest. I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.\n\nInstead, I will be a champion for the people.\n\nThe establishment media doesn\u2019t cover what really matters in this country, or what\u2019s really going on in people\u2019s lives. They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.\n\nJust imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed \u2013 she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.\n\nJust imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.\n\nJust think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools. Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.\n\nInstead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders. It\u2019s the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it\u2019s been rigged against.\n\nSo many people suffering in silence. No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.\n\nSo again, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s never been about me. It\u2019s about all the people in this country who don\u2019t have a voice.\n\nI am running to be their voice.\n\nI am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.\n\nI am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again \u2013 including some powerful people in my own party. Because it means I am fighting for real change.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.\n\nIt\u2019s the powerful protecting the powerful.\n\nThe insiders fighting for the insiders.\n\nI am fighting for you.\n\nHere is the change I propose.\n\nOn terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nWe will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.\n\nOn immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed. All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn\u2019t share our values and love our people. Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa. If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life. Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.\n\nWe will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.\n\nMy opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration. Hillary Clinton is running to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel, and we\u2019ve seen how much crime and how many problems that\u2019s caused the German people.\n\nWe have enough problems already, we don\u2019t need another one.\n\nOn crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world. We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.\n\nThe gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one. Their day is over.\n\nOn trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.\n\nHillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.\n\nOn taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses \u2013 creating millions of new good paying jobs.\n\nWe are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.\n\nOn education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive. We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones. My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. She doesn\u2019t care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.\n\nWe are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities \u2013 and what a big difference that will make. This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.\n\nOn healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina. We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare \u2013 at a much lower cost.\n\nOn political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.\n\nIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.\n\nI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.\n\nI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.\n\nFinally, we are going to bring this country together. We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.\n\nIf African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing. Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership \u2013 look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working. It is time for change.\n\nWhat do you have to lose by trying something new? \u2013 I will fix it. This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.\n\nHillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted. Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.\n\nIt is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.\n\nIn my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\n\nThis is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.\n\nBut we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.\n\n72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track. I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.\n\nIt is time to vote for a New American Future.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make American Proud Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nFriends and fellow citizens: Come November, We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank You, And God Bless.", "likes": 31380, "time": 1471567789.0}, {"message": "Crooked Hillary Clinton #ThrowbackThursday:", "likes": 65388, "time": 1471557542.0}, {"message": "'Donald Trump delivered one of the most avowedly conservative speeches America has heard in 50 years, contending for the Democratic votes, minority votes and inner city votes.

I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Prebius, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWe are at a decisive moment in this election.  Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.  Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.  Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness.\n\nLet me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.  The violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.  Law and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.\n\nThe main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods.  It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.\nThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct.  Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.\n\nThe narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one.  The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.  \n\nMore law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.\nJust like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it.\n\nThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society \u2013 a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent \u2013 share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.\n\nThey have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.  Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives \u2013 whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore \u2013 and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.\n\nDuring the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded.  More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama\u2019s hometown area since his presidency began.\nHow are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?\n\nThe war on our police must end.  It must end now!\n\nThe war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.  \nOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor.  Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets.  Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus.  Or the young child walking home from school.  For every one violent protestor, there are a hundred of moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.  My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.\n\nHillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities. \nI care too much about my country to let that happen.  \nWe all care too much about our country to let that happen.\nGood policing saves lives.  \n\nMy dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this.  The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent.  Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.\n\nImagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn\u2019t blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City?  I\u2019ll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country.\nIt\u2019s easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force.  I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.\n\nHillary Clinton has had her chance.  She failed.  Now it\u2019s time for new leadership. The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.\n\nThere is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people.  It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American \u2013 and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time.\nI am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.\n\nIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.  The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community.  Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.\n\nLet us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade.  Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings.  18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims.  The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average.  Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job.  Nearly Four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty.  55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil. There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it\u2019s one of the worst public school systems in the country.\n\n1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.\n\nTo every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future. \n\nThe Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted.  They\u2019ve just assumed they\u2019ll get your support and done nothing in return for it.  It\u2019s time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it\u2019s time to rebuild the inner cities of America \u2013 and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.\n\nI\u2019m not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me.  I\u2019ve been paying my own way.  The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.  \n\nThe other party \u2013 the Democratic Party \u2013 nominated the personification of special interest corruption.  The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.\n\nI am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help.  The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.\n\nJobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation. \nWe reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.  She doesn\u2019t care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.\n\nThe African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party.  It\u2019s time to break with the failures of the past \u2013 I want to offer Americans a new future.\nIt is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.\n\nEvery insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.  The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.  \n\nIt\u2019s the powerful protecting the powerful.\n\nInsiders fighting for insiders.  \n\nI am fighting for you!\n\nWhen we talk about the insider, who are we talking about?  It\u2019s the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests.  It\u2019s the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill.  It\u2019s the financial industry knows how to regulate their competition out of existence.  The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.\n\nEvery day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and hear about how some banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.  Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.  Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.\n\nI wear their opposition as a badge of honor.  Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.  I am fighting \u2013 all of us across the country are fighting \u2013 for peaceful regime change in our own country.  The media-donor-political complex that\u2019s bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\n\nThe leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.\n\nI am going to give the people their voice back.\nThink about it.  The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.\n\nThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another.\nThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.\n\nAren\u2019t you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?\n\nAren\u2019t you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?\n\nAre you ready for change?\n\nAre you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first?\nLet\u2019s talk about what this means for the inner cities of America.  \n\nIt\u2019s time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests.  I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system \u2013 a lot of people who\u2019ve created our problems \u2013 will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.\n  \nIt\u2019s time to stop making the special interests rich.  It\u2019s time to make the American people rich.\n\nI am going to Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nThe Democratic Party has run every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.\n\nThey\u2019ve ruined the schools. \n\nThey\u2019ve driven out the jobs.\n\nThey\u2019ve tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.\n\nViolent crime has risen 17% in America\u2019s 50 largest cities last year.  Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent.  Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore. They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.  \n\nThis is future offered by Hillary Clinton. More poverty, more crime, and more of the same.  The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.  It is time for a different future. \n\nHere is what I am proposing.\n\nFirst, on immigration.  No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton\u2019s immigration policies than the African-American community.  Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans.  I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community. We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.\n\nOn trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job.\nOn taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores \u2013 and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.  I am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee.  Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas. I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.\n\nOn education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers. We are going to put students and parents first.  \nHillary Clinton would deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.  I am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.\n\nOn crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods.  To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.\n\nOn healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare \u2013 which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases \u2013 and give choice to patients and consumers.  Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out \u2013 as are many of the major insurance companies.\n\nOn government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government.  We\u2019ve seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense.  We\u2019ve seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government.\nIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.  No one will be above the law.\nI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.\n\nI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government. This is all just the beginning.\n\nWe are going to make this a government of the people once again.  This is our chance to take back power from all the people who\u2019ve taken it from you.  The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.\n\nThese are tough times.  But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.  To do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.  I will be your fighter.\n\nTo defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina.  Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have that strength and stamina.  She cannot win for you.\n\nMost importantly, she has bad judgment.

It\u2019s wonderful to be in Detroit.\nWe now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America.  It\u2019s a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.\n\nThe City of Detroit Is Where Our Story Begins\nDetroit was once the economic envy of the world.  The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.\nWhen we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming.  Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream. But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.\n\nWhen we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit.  Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.\n\nToday, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average.  40 percent of the city\u2019s residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Half of all Detroit residents do not work.\nDetroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime \u2013 these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.  \n\nIn short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent\u2019s failed economic agenda.  Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.\n \nShe supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community\u2026and the crime policies that have made you less safe\u2026and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets...and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries\u2026 and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.\n \nShe is the candidate of the past.\n \nOurs is the campaign of the future.\n \nThis is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.\n \nToday, I will outline my economic vision.  In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.\n \nOur opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas.  All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.  \n \nIf you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn\u2019t do better than Hillary Clinton\u2019s economic agenda.  \n \nNothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.\n \nThe one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States.  Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.\n \nThat\u2019s why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.\n \nMy campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.\n \nHere is what an America First economic plan looks like.\n \nFirst, let\u2019s talk tax reform.\n \nTaxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.\n \nHillary Clinton \u2013 who has spent her career voting for tax increases \u2013 plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase.  Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.  \n \nRecently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again \u2013 to use a now famous term \u2013 when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.\n \nI am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.\n \nThe rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.  \n\nAs part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.\n \nTax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.\n \nOur current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance.\n \nMy plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process.  We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent.  For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.\n \nWhile we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.\n\nThese reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.  \n \nWe will Make America Grow Again.\n \nIn the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family.  It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.\n \nThe State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed leadership.  The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton\u2019s broken promises.  She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator.  But what happened?  The Washington Post writes, and I quote: \u201cupstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent\u2026the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation\u2026 Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run\u2026data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton\u2019s first term.\u201d\n \nCompare that to my record.  In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, \u201cHow Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,\u201d the paper writes that I \u2013 and this is a direct quote \u2013 \u201cwaded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out\u2026almost by force of will \u2014 [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.\u201d\n \nThis is what I want to do for our country \u2013 I want to jumpstart America.\n \nNow let\u2019s look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.\n \nTheir policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.\n \nThere are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force.  It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people.\n \nThe Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.\n \nHome ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\n \nNearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office.  Another nearly 7 million Americans are living in poverty.\n \nWe have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.\n \n58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.\n \n1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force.  These are the real unemployment numbers \u2013 the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.\n \nMeanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.\n \nThe average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes.  On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.\n\nThe United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent.   It\u2019s almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.  \nIn other words, we punish companies for making products in America \u2013 but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas.\nThis is backwards.  All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.\n\nUnder my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes.  Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan.  Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business.  I am going to cut regulations massively.\nOur lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country \u2013 and into cities like Detroit.   To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.\n\nNo one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.\nMy plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.\nWe are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas.  Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax.  This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.\n\nFinally, no family will have to pay the death tax.  American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death \u2013 it\u2019s just plain wrong. We will repeal it.\nNext comes regulatory reform\n\nAs with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America\n\nMotor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.\n\nIt is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year \u2013 that\u2019s money taken straight out of cities like yours.\nThe federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more.\nIn 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations \u2013 each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy.\nIt is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.\n\nUpon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.  My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.\n\nI will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.\nNext, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs.  Those regulations will be eliminated.\nWe are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win.  When I am president, we will.  \nOne of the most important reforms of all is trade reform. \n\nAs Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment.  We\u2019ve seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria.  We\u2019ve seen it in Iran.  We\u2019ve seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.\nBut we\u2019ve also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.  \nShe supported Bill Clinton\u2019s NAFTA, she supported China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.  \n\nPresident Obama, and the usual so-called experts who\u2019ve been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion \u2013 resulting in some 70,000 jobs.\n\nLike Hillary Clinton\u2019s broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute.  Our exports to South Korea haven\u2019t increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion \u2013 more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.\n\nThe next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed.  Her donors will make sure of it. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP \u2013 and it\u2019s also a vote for NAFTA.\nOur annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion.  Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.\n\nThis is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.  \n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan.  Today, that number is only 160,000 Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton\u2019s apology. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry.  In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nMichigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved.  That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen.  Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.\n\nBecause my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website.  It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA.  If we don\u2019t get a better deal, we will walk away.\n\nAt the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China.  This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.  \n\nChina is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit.  They break the rules in every way imaginable.  China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property.  They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers.\nJust enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs.  According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America\u2019s intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.\n\nTrade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade.  But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.  Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.\n\nAlso critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. The Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.\n \nAs a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. Hillary Clinton says her plan will \u201cput a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.\u201d  \n \nWe will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.\n \nClinton not only embraces President Obama\u2019s job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.\n \nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\n \nA Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.\n \nAccording to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:\n \n\u2022 Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;\n \n\u2022 Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;\n \n\u2022 Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.  \n \nThe reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning\n \nWhen we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.\n \nWe can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.  \n \nAs part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families.  I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.\n \nLikewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.\n \nWe will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country.  Without security, there can be no prosperity.  We must have law and order.\n \nIn the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items.  One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.\n \nWe will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide \u2013 saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.\n \nWe also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration.  This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.\n \nDetroit \u2013 the Motor City \u2013 will come roaring back.  We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.\n \nOur party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.\n \nThe other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday \u2013 who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.\n \nThere will be no change under Hillary Clinton \u2013 only four more years of Obama.\n \nBut we are going to look boldly into the future.\n\nWe will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves.\n \nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n \nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.\n \nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this nation.\n \nIt will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy - mined from American sources - that powers this country.\n\nIt will be American workers who are hired to do the job.\n\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.\n\nOur country will reach amazing new heights.\n\nAll we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past.\n\nWe can\u2019t fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.\n\nWe can\u2019t solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them.\n\nOnly by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.\n\nWe need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.\n \nBefore everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn\u2019t be done.\n \nAmerica is ready to prove the doubters wrong.\n \nThey want you to think small.  I am asking you to think big.\n \nWe are ready to dream great things for our country once again.\n \nWe are ready to show the world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before.\n \nThank you, and God Bless You.", "likes": 23637, "time": 1470674834.0}, {"message": "Arrived in Detroit - on the way to deliver my economic speech!

The campaign\u2019s digital and direct mail operations (in conjunction with the RNC) resulted in approximately $64 million dollars in donations for July. Last month we continued our $2 million matching program from Mr. Trump bringing his overall contributions to the campaign in excess of $56 million. His contributions for the month far surpass the FEC required reimbursements to his related entities, i.e., airplane, Trump properties and the like. The Campaign and both Joint Fundraising Committees also have very strong cash on hand numbers totaling approximately $74 million ($37 million for DJTFP, $37 million for TMAGA/TV). The results from this month show the enthusiastic movement the campaign has created since we started our online fundraising efforts in June. The campaign very much appreciates the broad based support, and will work hard to achieve victory in November and Make America Great Again. \n\nThe campaign, in conjunction with the RNC, also hosted 20 fundraising events throughout the country for Trump Victory raising over $16 million. The Campaign continues to work with the RNC to support its important operations for the Republican Party, and elect Republicans down the ballot this November. \n\nThe campaign expects this success to continue throughout the coming months with the support of small dollar contributions from passionate supporters across the country. \n\n\u201cWe are extremely proud of our 69% growth in small dollar donations which shows the broad based support of over one million donors across America.

Ty\u2019s sacrifice saved more than twenty-five American lives, and he is truly an American hero. \n\nMr. Woods chose to endorse Mr. Trump stating, \u201cI support Donald Trump, and the main reason is national security as well as the economy are the two most important issues that voters are going to have to decide upon next November.\u201d \n\nHillary Clinton's poor judgment led to these tragic deaths in Libya. First, her reckless decision to invade Libya unleashed radical Islamic terror groups that threatened Americans. Compounded with her failure to provide the necessary security upgrades and reinforcements cost four Americans their lives. After it all, she lied to the world about what happened to cover up the role of Radical Islam. We could have known more about her actions, but she illegally stored and then deleted 33,000 emails. \n\nMr. Trump stated, \u201cTyrone Woods is an American hero and his father is a tremendous person whom I have great respect for.

Trump; \nAnti-Trump Effort Dealt Crippling Blow\n\n(New York) July 11, 2016 \u2013 Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued \u2013 in line with overwhelming public opinion \u2013 that RNC delegates must follow election results and that delegates cannot be stolen at the national convention. Delegate Beau Correll, Jr., had brought the suit against the Commonwealth of Virginia hoping to reject the will of the voters, but was soundly defeated.\n\nSpecifically, the Court found that RNC Rule 16, which binds delegates based on their election results, \u201cis in effect presently and that it controls the allocation and binding of delegates as to their voting at convention.\u201d (p. 6) The Court held that the Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cexpert testimony\u201d from Erling \u2018Curly\u2019 Haugland was not credible, lacked \u201ctextual support,\u201d (p.6) and that \u201cdelegates are bound by RNC Rule 16.\u201d (p. 7)\n\nFurther, the Court found that by signing the \u201cDeclaration and Statement of Qualification,\u201d RNC delegates are bound by RNC Rule 16(c)(2) (p. 10), and that this Declaration obligated Correll to vote in accordance with Republican Party rules and Virginia\u2019s election results. (p. 46)\n\nTrump Campaign Attorney and former FEC Chairman Don McGahn issued the following statement:\n\n\"The court has confirmed what we have said all along: Rule 16 is in effect and thus delegates, including Correll, are bound to vote in accordance with the election results. The court did not buy what Curly Haugland was selling, and noted that his testimony has no support in the rule's text and was contradicted by his own book, Unbound. This case puts his unbound theory to rest, and is a fatal blow to the Anti-Trump agitators.\u201d", "likes": 23609, "time": 1468284781.0}, {"message": "Wow - FLORIDA! Great new poll numbers!
